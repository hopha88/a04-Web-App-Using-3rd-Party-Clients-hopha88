In our modern society, the internet has become a very robust and useful place where you can find information on pretty much anything you want or need.

However, I feel as we progress in leaps and bounds towards development, I feel the internet has begun to lack something quite crucial... completely useless websites. No, I don't mean X (formerly Twitter). In all our progress, we have forgotten our roots. 

Such is my mission today. 

In my client-side web application, I utilize these 3rd party APIs:
    1. TheCatAPI - https://developers.thecatapi.com/
    2. Forismatic - https://forismatic.com/en/api/
    
    to create an image of a 'dancing' cat that shares some wisdom. I take a couple random cat images from TheCatAPI, display a quote from forismatic, and let them dance to a song my friend made. :)

My application is not nearly as complex as the example given in class, but I wanted to have a bit of simple fun. Also, the quotes kind of aren't that wise, but they're really jsut waht I had to work with. Enjoy!

To use this application, you will need a TheCatAPI API key.
