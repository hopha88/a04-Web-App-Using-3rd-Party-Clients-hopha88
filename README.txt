In our modern society, the internet has become a very robust and useful place where you can find information on pretty much anything you want or need.

However, I feel as we progress in leaps and bounds towards development, I feel the internet lacks something quite crucial... completely useless websites.
In all our progress, we have forgotten our roots, 

Such is my mission today. 

I use these 3rd party APIs:
    1. TheCatAPI - https://developers.thecatapi.com/view-account/ylX4blBYT9FaoVd6OhvR?report=FJkYOq9tW
    2. 
    
    to create my web application. I take a couple random cat images from TheCatAPI, then let them dance to a song from . :)

My application is not nearly as complex as the example given in class, but I wanted to have a bit of simple fun.
